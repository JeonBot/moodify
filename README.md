# moodify

## Inspiration
We often find it difficult to express our feelings in words. However, the human face does this effortlessly. We want to use the power of deep learning to read these emotions and recommend the perfect playlist for your mood.

moodify, powered by emotion. 

## What it does
Send our Telegram bot [@moodifybot](telegram.me/moodifybot) a selfie and it will recommend a playlist to suit your mood!

## How we built it
We leveraged the power of Microsoft Cognitive Services to detect a person's mood from their facial expression, used that information to choose a Spotify playlist, and packaged it up into an easy-to-use Telegram bot.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Learning to use awesome new libraries and APIs

## What we learned
- Creating a telegram bot using Python
- Leveraging APIs

## What's next for moodify
Generating custom playlists using machine learning
